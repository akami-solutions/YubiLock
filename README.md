# YubiLock Open Source

YubiLock, formerly a project of Satowa Network, has been acquired by Akami Solutions and released as open source. It is a Windows program that aims to improve the security of Windows systems.

# What does YubiLock do?

Originally, YubiLock was a simple program that checked whether a YubiKey was plugged in. If the YubiKey was removed from the computer, the currently logged-in user was automatically locked. The user could only log in again if the YubiKey was plugged back in or the lock was deactivated in another way.

Since February 26, 2024, YubiLock has been under further development by Akami Solutions and is being transformed from a simple program to a service.
